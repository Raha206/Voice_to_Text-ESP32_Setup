# Voice_to_Text-ESP32_Setup
This repository contains two tasks.  
TASK 1 : In this task to convert audio to text, HTML, CSS, JS were used. Initially, a start HTML file was created that contains a link to link it with the speech-to-text page and contains the start button. When you press it, the index HTML page will open asking the user to allow the microphone to be used. Click on Allow and talk and here the speech will be converted to text using JavaScript  reference :https://youtu.be/-k-PgvbktX4  
TASK 2 : is about setting up Arduino ESP32 step by step until its ready to be used. I explained how to set it up using Arduino IDE  reference : https://youtu.be/h8iHRy48a8I
